"""
This file contains the competency questions (Gr√ºninger and Fox 1995) to evaluate the Esther ontology of rhetorical
figures in English.
Q1 and Q2 are the same as used by the RetFig and GRhOOT ontology for comparison.

Q1: Rhetorical figures that have their defining element in a word.
Q2: Rhetorical figures where a letter is omitted.
Q3: Figures that are neither figures of construction, nor figures of speech, nor figures of thought.
Q4: All figures that are tropes (should be same output as Q3).
Q5: Example sentences for the figure Alliteration.
Q6: Definition of the figure Parallelism.
Q7: Figures of speech or figures of thought with position beginning.
Q8: Figures with a repeated element of the same form.
Q9: Figures where a word in the same form is repeated.
Q10: Figures and their opposite figures.
