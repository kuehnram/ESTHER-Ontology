"""
This file contains the competency questions (Gr√ºninger and Fox 1995) to evaluate the Esther ontology of rhetorical
figures in English.
Q1 and Q2 are the same as used by the RetFig and GRhOOT ontology for comparison.

Q1: Which rhetorical figures have their defining element in a word?
Q2: In which rhetorical figures is a letter omitted?
Q3: What are figures that are neither figures of construction, nor figures of speech, nor figures of thought?
Q4: Which figures belong to the rhetorical group of tropes (should be the same output as Q3)?
Q5: What is an example sentence for the figure alliteration?
Q6: What is the definition of the figure parallelism?
Q7: Which figures of speech or figures of thought have their defining element in the beginning?
Q8: Which figures have  repeat an element in the same form?
Q9: In which figures is a word in the same form repeated?
Q10: Which figures are the opposite of other figures?
